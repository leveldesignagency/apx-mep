              </p>
              <p>
                BAFE registration is very important for those in the UK fire safety and protection industry. Many organisations now require BAFE registration from those who install or maintain their fire safety systems, products and services. For many working in the fire and protection industry, BAFE registration is a commercial imperative.
              </p>
              <p>
                The BAFE register also brings customers together with companies they can trust, with a directory of independently audited and approved providers. If you would like to know more you can view our BAFE registration online.
