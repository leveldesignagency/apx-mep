                A recent installation that we carried out in a residential London property featured black external laser detectors as shown in the images alongside. The laser-based security creates virtual curtains and surveillance security zones that offer the highest levels of precision for accurate and reliable intrusion detection.

              <p>
                Laser-based detection systems such as this are ideal for securing open sites and are a great option for perimeter protection, intrusion detection, for alerting you to pedestrian and vehicle access and for protection against theft and vandalism.
